# 🍔 Burganova

A responsive and user-friendly **online burger ordering platform** for a cloud kitchen, developed using **Odoo**. This system allows customers to explore a mouthwatering menu, place delivery or pickup orders, and track them in real-time. Admins handle everything from the Odoo backend — managing orders, burgers, feedback, and more. *No dine-in available — just juicy burgers to-go!*

## 📌 1. Project Overview

As junior developers, we individually built a full-stack **burger ordering platform** using **Odoo as a CMS**. The project is centered around cloud kitchen operations — offering **pickup and delivery only**. Customers can place orders, manage profiles, and track order progress, while the Admin has full control through the Odoo backend.
